# Radial_Hydride_Code

### **Description:**
This is a package developed to aid in the charactacterisation of radial hydrides from micrographs. The main functions of this package are to: 
- Determine the Radial Hydride Fraction (RHF)
- Characterise the extent of branching
- Determine the most probably crack path within a micrograph

### **For this code to work several software packages must be installed:**
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib
- Skimage
- Scipy
- Numba
- Skan

Example Micrographs that can be used for testing of the code are located in the 'Example Micrographs Folder'
